# Enriching News Data

NewFetch now provides libraries to run various enrichments to the News data that has been processed from CommonCrawl,
well, technically not limited to CommonCrawl, but that is the source of data we have been talking about.

The enrichments are provided as a library, and can be used in any Python application. 

More details are available in the [NewsFetch Enrichments documentation](https://newsfetch.tech/docs/features/enriched-news).
