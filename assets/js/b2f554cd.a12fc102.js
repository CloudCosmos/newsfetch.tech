This history, for anyone\\ncurious, is documented [here](https://newsfetch.tech/docs/newsfetch-history).\\n\\nNews is one of the widely consumed and researched dataset. NewsFetch builds on top of other phenomenal open source projects:\\n\\n* [CommonCrawl - https://commoncrawl.org](https://commoncrawl.org)\\n  * More specifically [CommonCrawl News Dataset] (https://commoncrawl.org/2016/10/news-dataset-available/)\\n* [NewsPlease](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please)\\n* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\\n* [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)\\n* [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)\\n* Python\\n* Postgres / SQLite\\n* OpenSearch\\n\\n... and many other libraries and pre-built machine learning models in NLP, NLP and text processing space.\\n\\n# Project details\\n\\nWe started working on this project, basically taking out parts from the various CloudCosmos product efforts, and getting\\nthem into the open-source project, over the September 2022 Labor Day (US long holiday weekend), and have been continuing\\nthe work over the wekeends. We got to a stage after this weekend\'s effort, where an initial version could be published.\\n\\nThe project is hosted at [Github/NewsFetch](https://github.com/newsfetch/newsfetch)\\n\\n## What is available?\\n\\n\\n* A standardized data model for processed news content\\n* A data processing pipeline to:\\n  * Fetching data from CommonCrawl, which is in WARC archive format\\n  * Extracting the article content from the WARC archive\\n  * Processing the article HTML to extract content to the standardized format\\n* Lots of documentation\\n* Dockerfile for the pipeline mentioned\\n* A sample API that shows what can be done with data\\n\\n## What is coming?\\n\\n* Text enrichments\\n  * Standardized flow that will apply enrichments using pre-build machine-learning models from Spacy/HuggingFace etc\\n  * Named entity recognition, Summarization, Topic detection etc\\n  * Reading difficult level metrics\\n  * Generative question answering\\n* Sample apps to showcase:\\n  * News analytics\\n  * Alerting\\n  * Podcast creation for \\"happening\\" news\\n  * Social media signal detection\\n\\n## Any feature requests?\\n\\nIf you see something missing in the above, and would like for us to consider building it, please contact us."}]}')}}]);
