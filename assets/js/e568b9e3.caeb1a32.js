The fire has destroyed at least 30 homes and other structures in Riverside County. Two people died while fleeing flames last Monday.\\nThe southern part of the state welcomed the cooler weekend weather as a tropical storm veered off the Pacific Coast and faded, helping put an end to blistering temperatures that nearly overwhelmed the state\\u2019s electrical grid.\\nThunderstorms and the risk of flooding persisted in mountainous areas of greater Los Angeles on Sunday. But after Hurricane Kay made landfall in Mexico last week it quickly was downgraded and weakened further until it largely disappeared, forecasters said.\\nIn Washington state, a raging wildfire sparked Saturday in the remote Stevens Pass area sent hikers fleeing and forced evacuations of mountain communities. There was no containment Sunday of the Bolt Creek Fire, which had scorched nearly 12 square miles (31 square kilometers) of forestland east of Seattle.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be several days\\u201d before crews get a handle on the blaze, Peter Mongillo, spokesperson for Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue, told the Seattle Times.\\nCalifornia\\u2019s Mosquito Fire has covered a large portion of the Northern Sierra region with smoke. California health officials urged people in affected areas to stay indoors where possible. Organizers of the Tour de Tahoe canceled the annual 72-mile (115-km) bicycle ride scheduled Sunday around Lake Tahoe because of the heavy smoke from the blaze \\u2014 more than 50 miles (80 km) away. Last year\\u2019s ride was canceled because of smoke from another big fire south of Tahoe.\\nThe Mosquito Fire\\u2019s cause remained under investigation. Pacific Gas & Electric said unspecified \\u201celectrical activity\\u201d occurred close in time to the report of the fire on Tuesday.\\nScientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.
